Dear visitor,

thanks for visiting my Github pages.
Here is my first try to build up a restaurant website using Django framework.
I know that it might look a bit simple, but behind Python language with Django framework is used. 
As DB I decided to leave SQLite because of simplicity usage and no need for scalability, but for my next try seems to be MySQL might be good choise.
In case if you have found some mistakes or you have some suggestions, how to improve the application, please, let me know.

Many thanks and good luck!

Best regadrs
Viktoriia
