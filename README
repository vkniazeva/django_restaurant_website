Dear visitor,

thanks for visiting my Github pages.
Here is my first try to build up a restaurant website using Django framework.
I know that it might look a bit simple, but behind Python language with Django framework is used. 
As DB, I decided to leave SQLite because of simplicity usage and no need for scalability, but for my next try seems to be MySQL might be good choice.

To build the application locally, you will need to set up a virtual environment and run the server locally.
Here are some instructions, how to do it.

0. Ensure you have python3 installed on your local machine: $python3 --version
1. Install virtual environment: $pip3 install virtualenv (make sure, you are doing it from the project location folder)
2. Install Django: $pip3 install Django
3. Run server: $python3 manage.py runserver

In case if you have found some mistakes or you have some suggestions, how to improve the application, please, let me know.

Many thanks and good luck!

Best regards
Viktoriia
